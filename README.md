# Survey-Paper-on-Lane-Detection

Lane Detection is a mechanism designed to warn 
the driver when the vehicle begins to move out of its lane (unless 
a turn signal is on in that direction) on freeways and arterial 
roads. These systems are designed to minimize accidents by 
addressing the main causes of collisions: driver error, 
distractions and drowsiness. Several approaches have been 
proposed for lane detection in self-driving and self-driven 
vehicles. We discuss three of these approaches in this survey 
paper- Robust Lane Detection Using Multiple Features, 
Vanishing Point Detection for self-driving car using harmony 
search algorithm, A Precise Lane Detection Algorithm Based on 
Top View Image Transformation and Least-Square Approache
